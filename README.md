Hello there! This package has the goal of making it easy to simulate electrode recording, optogenetics, and real-time input and output processing with the Brian 2 spiking neural network simulator. While CLEOsim was created to facilitate prototyping closed-loop control experiments, we hope the electrode and optogenetics components will be useful outside this scope for the broader audience of those wanting to bridge neuroscience modeling/theory and experiment.

This package was developed by [Kyle Johnsen](https://kjohnsen.org) and Nathan Cruzado under the direction of [Chris Rozell](https://siplab.gatech.edu) at Georgia Institute of Technology.

## Getting started
Just use pip to install:
```
pip install cleosim
```

For a more detailed discussion of motivation, structure, and basic usage, head to the [overview section](https://cleosim.readthedocs.io/en/latest/overview.html) of the documentation.
