Hello there! CLEOsim has the goal of bridging theory and experiment for mesoscale neuroscience, facilitating electrode recording, optogenetic stimulation, and closed-loop experiments (e.g., real-time input and output processing) with the [Brian 2](https://brian2.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) spiking neural network simulator. We hope users will find these components useful for prototyping experiments, innovating methods, and testing observations about a hypotheses *in silico*, incorporating into spiking neural network models laboratory techniques ranging from passive observation to complex model-based feedback control. CLEOsim also serves as an extensible, modular base for developing additional recording and stimulation modules for Brian simulations.

This package was developed by [Kyle Johnsen](https://kjohnsen.org) and Nathan Cruzado under the direction of [Chris Rozell](https://siplab.gatech.edu) at Georgia Institute of Technology.

CLEOsim allows for flexible I/O processing in real time, enabling the simulation of closed-loop experiments such as event-triggered or feedback control. The user can also add latency to closed-loop stimulation to study the effects of computation delays.

CLEOsim provides functions for configuring electrode arrays and placing them in arbitrary locations in the simulation. The user can then specify parameters for probabilistic spike detection or a spike-based LFP approximation developed by [Tele≈Ñczuk et al., 2020](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0165027020302946).

By providing an optic fiber-light propagation model, CLEOsim enables users to flexibly add photostimulation to their model. Both a four-state Markov state model of opsin dynamics is available, as well as a minimal proportional current option for compatibility with simple neuron models. Parameters are provided for the common blue light/ChR2 setup.

## Getting started
Just use pip to install:
```
pip install cleosim
```

Then head to the [overview section of the documentation](https://cleosim.readthedocs.io/en/latest/overview.html) for a more detailed discussion of motivation, structure, and basic usage.

## Related resources
Those using CLEOsim to simulate closed-loop control experiments may be interested in software developed for the execution of real-time, *in-vivo* experiments. Developed by members of [Chris Rozell](https://siplab.gatech.edu)'s and [Garrett Stanley](https://stanley.gatech.edu/)'s labs at Georgia Tech, the [CLOCTools repository](https://github.com/stanley-rozell/cloctools/blob/main/README.md) can serve these users in two ways:

1. By providing utilities and interfaces with experimental platforms for moving from simulation to reality.
2. By providing performant control and estimation algorithms for feedback control. Although CLEOsim enables closed-loop manipulation of network simulations, it does not include any advanced control algorithms itself. The `ldsCtrlEst` library implements adaptive linear dynamical system-based control while the `hmm` library can generate and decode systems with discrete latent states and observations.
